<h1> Hi, I'm Leo! :octocat: </h1> 


Hello, I'm Leo and I really love ☕, life science and programming. Thus, I'm trying to put this all together and solve problems, creat products and do science. When I'm not brewing my coffee or getting mad with at sh1t code made by me, I'm playing video games, drawing, listening to 🎶 and podcasts about tech.  

<h2> My values </h2> 

☄️ Imagination is more important than knowledge, but It's still important <br><br>
🏞️ The truth is like a river: As time pass by, it'll change - and you need to understand these changes fast. <br><br>
🧬 You may not believe it neither like it, but If it is true now, it is true no matter what - and it'd be better to you handle with it fast.<br><br>
🌖 You are free to make your choices, but you are a prisoner of the consequences
